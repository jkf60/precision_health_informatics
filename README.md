# Precision Health Informatics

Overview

This repository contains the work for a the course as well as a midterm and final project focusing on Precision Medicine and Health Informatics. The primary goal is to utilize gene expression data to identify significant genes linked to primary bladder cancer.

Project Summary

Objective: To leverage gene expression data for identifying key genes in primary bladder cancer, contributing to precision medicine efforts.

Methodology: The project involves cleaning and prepping data for Welch’s T-test, followed by a detailed gene expression analysis. Clinical and molecular data from 233 samples were examined, normalized, and transformed as necessary.

Key Steps:
1. Data Preparation: Ensuring data de-identification and normalization.
2. Filtering and Subsetting: Aligning subject IDs and selecting relevant samples.
3. Baseline and Comparison Group Identification: Using bladder cancer types to differentiate between normal tissue and surrounding mucosae.
4. Data Analysis: Performing Welch’s T-tests to compare baseline and cancer-adjacent tissues.
5. Result Interpretation: Identifying top significant genes based on p-value from the T-test results.

Goals of Precision Medicine in Health Informatics

1. Personalized Treatment: Tailoring medical treatment to individual characteristics of each patient.
2. Early Detection: Identifying diseases like cancer at an early stage, where they are more likely to be treated successfully.
3. Data-Driven Decisions: Utilizing large datasets to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.

Significance

This project contributes to the broader goals of precision medicine by identifying potential biomarkers for bladder cancer, aiding in the development of targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes.
